        <h2>Featured Species</h2>
        <p>There are many species found around the world that shouldn't be in the area that they are in. </p>
        <p>One example of an invasive species is the zebra mussel. It has been found in places all over the U.S.</p>
        <p>Another example of an invasive species is the Asian tiger mosquito. </p>

    <section id="impact" class="container">
        <h2>Impact on Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>The reason why invasive species are invasive is because they ruin the chances of native animals being successful.</p>
        <p>For example, the zebra mussel impacts the species they are found in by reducing the amount of food in the area.</p>

        <h2>Preventing Introduction</h2>
        <p>The ways people control invasive species are called control methods.</p>
        <p>There are multiple control methods people come up with to get rid of an invasive species. However, all of them might not be the most effectivce.</p>
        <p>One example of a control method for zebra mussels is potassium cloride. Scientists have tested this method, but it is known to affect other species.</p>
        <p>Even though potassium chloride is the most effective, scientists don't want to use it in big bodies of water. However, it is still called a conrol method.</p>
